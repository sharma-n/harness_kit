# CLAUDE.md — orientation for `harness_kit`

Read this first. It explains what this repo is, how it's structured, the rules that
keep it coherent, and how to run things. The full design rationale lives in
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md); current status and what's next lives in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## What this is

A stateful, multi-turn **agentic chatbot service** built **on top of**
[`llm_kit`](https://github.com/sharma-n/llm_kit) (a git dependency). `llm_kit` owns
provider wire formats, streaming `invoke_stream`, structured `invoke`, the embedder,
rate limiting, retries, and the error hierarchy. `harness_kit` adds the three things
`llm_kit` deliberately omits: **conversation state, memory, and a tool-calling agent
loop**, plus a serving layer.

`harness_kit` optimizes for the *opposite* of `llm_kit`: long-lived sessions, latency
(time-to-first-token), per-user state — not batch throughput.

## The non-negotiable rule: strict bottom-up layering

Each layer imports only from layers below it. Do not violate this.

```
config → stores → (skills || tools) → agent → serving
```

`skills/` and `tools/` sit at the same level — neither imports from the other.
`service.py` is the composition root (top) that wires everything from config.
`harness_kit/llm.py` holds thin `LLM` / `Embedder` Protocols over `llm_kit` so every
layer above depends on the Protocol, not the concrete client — that's what lets the
whole stack run against a `FakeLLM` in tests.

If you find yourself wanting a lower layer to import a higher one (e.g. `tools/`
importing `agent/events.py`), don't — pass primitives up instead. The registry
returns a plain `Execution`; the loop maps it to a `ToolResult` event.

## Multi-user is foundational (not a later feature)

This is a hard requirement, threaded through every layer:

- **Sessions are user-owned.** `SessionStore.load(conversation_id, user_id)` raises
  `UnauthorizedError` if the conversation belongs to a different user.
- **Memory is user-scoped.** Profile is per `user_id`; episodic search is always
  filtered by `user_id` — no cross-user leakage.
- **Tool permissions are per-user.** `PermissionStore` resolves each user's allowed
  tool set. The registry filters tool *definitions* by it AND re-checks on *execute*
  (defense in depth). The single global `config.yaml` only sets the default
  allowlist; per-user grants live in the store.

When adding anything that touches user data, ask: is it scoped to `user_id`? If a
new store/cache holds per-user state in process memory without a shared-store
backing, that breaks horizontal scaling (SPEC §12) — don't. (The one deliberate,
documented exception is the M10 tool rate limiter in `tools/ratelimit.py`: per-user
token buckets are in-process, mirroring `llm_kit`'s own limiter — so a multi-worker
deploy enforces ~`workers × rate_limit_per_minute`. A Redis backing is a later
scaling step, noted in the module docstring.)

## Async end-to-end

Everything is `async`. A synchronous DB/network call on the event loop stalls every
concurrent conversation — treat it as a bug. The in-memory stores are async too so
the real (Redis/SQLite/Qdrant) adapters drop in behind the identical Protocol.

## Key abstractions to know

- **`AgentEvent`** (`agent/events.py`): `TextDelta | ToolCallStarted |
  ToolApprovalRequired | ToolResult | TurnComplete`. `run_turn` yields these;
  `serving/wire.py` encodes them to JSON frames. This is the load-bearing abstraction
  — a streaming tool loop can't yield bare tokens.
- **The loop drives tools off `StreamEnd.response.tool_calls`.** `llm_kit`'s
  mid-stream `ToolCallStarted` is *name-only*; the assembled calls *with parsed
  arguments* arrive on `StreamEnd`. harness_kit emits its own `ToolCallStarted` (with
  args) at execution time.
- **Tool errors are observations, not exceptions.** A failed/denied/timed-out tool
  becomes `ToolResult(ok=False)` fed back to the model (SPEC §5). The only things
  that raise are `max_iterations` (graceful stop) and `UnauthorizedError`.
- **Context budgeter** evicts by tier: tier-0 (system/current msg/tool defs) never
  drops (→ `ContextOverflowError`); working buffer evicts oldest; episodic drops
  lowest score.

## Memory design decisions

- **Rolling-summary rollover is token-budget-driven** (`WorkingMemory.maybe_rollover`).
  When the verbatim buffer exceeds `WorkingMemoryConfig.buffer_token_budget`, the
  oldest turns are folded into the rolling summary (LLM `invoke` + `RolledSummary`
  response model) and dropped; the newest turns within budget stay. The trigger is
  token-driven (not a fixed turn count) so it holds regardless of turn size. It runs
  **off the hot path** — the loop enqueues it after `TurnComplete` — and is a safe
  no-op (no turns lost) when there's no LLM, nothing to evict, or the summarizer
  returns nothing usable. Sizing uses the shared `tokens.estimate_tokens`.

- **Episodic embedding is per-conversation, not per-turn** (`EpisodicMemory.write_conversation`,
  triggered by `Agent.end_conversation`). At conversation end the rolling summary +
  remaining buffer are embedded as ONE `kind="conversation"` point — cheaper and more
  compact than per-turn, trading per-turn recall precision for conversation-level memory.
  The point id is deterministic (`conv:{conversation_id}`) so re-finalizing a resumed
  conversation upserts rather than duplicating.

  When `EpisodicMemoryConfig.flagged_moments_enabled` is true, the LLM additionally
  identifies 1–`max_flagged_moments` notable **discussion threads** and embeds each as a
  sibling `kind="moment"` point (`moment:{conversation_id}:{i}`). These compete naturally
  with the conversation point in `top_k` search — no Protocol change, no context-assembly
  change. This is the two-layer balance: the conversation point handles broad "what was
  this conversation about?" recall; moment points handle precision recall for specific
  topics. Off by default; safe no-op when `llm` is None.

- **Conversation end is a two-stage idle lifecycle, not a single TTL** (config
  validates `idle_finalize_s < ttl_s`). `idle_finalize_s` fires first: the conversation
  is embedded but the session stays loadable so a returning user resumes seamlessly;
  `ttl_s` then evicts **the session from SessionStore only** — embeddings remain in
  VectorStore indefinitely (there is no TTL enforcement or deletion in the VectorStore
  Protocol; embeddings are write-only). `end_conversation` is best-effort and
  **idempotent** — missing/expired session or non-owner caller → no-op;
  `SessionState.finalized_at` (cleared on any new activity) stops re-embedding until
  the conversation is resumed. It is driven from two places: **WebSocket disconnect**
  in `serving/app.py` (fast path) and a **background idle sweeper**
  (`Agent.sweep_idle`, started in the serving lifespan, cadence `sweep_interval_s`).
  The sweeper is what gives **SSE** — which has no disconnect signal — a
  conversation-end event, and also catches abrupt WS drops.

- **Background writes are fire-and-forget with logging + retry** — `extract`, `maybe_rollover`,
  `mark_finalized`, and `write_conversation` are enqueued via `Agent._enqueue()` and run
  off the hot path. A failure is no longer silent: `_guard()` logs one ERROR with
  operation + `user_id` + `conversation_id`; `sweep_idle` logs per-conversation WARNING
  and continues (no cascade). Store-write retries (via `retry.store_write()`) wrap **only**
  the store call, not the preceding LLM/embedder step — that's already retried by llm_kit,
  so a transient store fault never re-runs the model. Tunable via `MemoryConfig.store_retry`.
  All background store ops are verified idempotent (except append-only `append_turn`).

## Offline jobs design decisions (M8)

- **`jobs/` sits alongside `serving/`** at the top of the layer stack. It imports from
  `stores/`, `memory/`, `config/`, and directly from `llm_kit` (concrete clients with
  `run_batch_stream` / `embed_batch`). It does NOT import from `agent/` or `serving/`.
  Jobs are CLI scripts, not embedded in the FastAPI lifespan.

- **VectorStore Protocol gained `delete` and `list_points`**. The existing "write-only"
  invariant was updated: `delete(point_ids, *, user_id)` verifies ownership inside the
  adapter before deleting — the caller is never trusted to pass only their own IDs.
  Qdrant verifies via `retrieve()` (fetch + payload check) then deletes only owned UUIDs.

- **Age-decay is runtime, not a batch job** (`EpisodicMemoryConfig.decay_rate = 0.05`).
  `retrieve()` multiplies each hit's score by `exp(-rate * age_days)` after fetching
  `top_k * 2` candidates, then re-sorts and re-caps. Zero writes, always current.

- **Dedup uses cosine similarity + Union-Find** (not HDBSCAN). Pairwise cosine matrix
  (numpy), edges where `sim >= similarity_threshold`, connected components via Union-Find
  with path compression. Handles transitivity correctly. No new dependencies.

- **`forget_memory` tool** — episodic counterpart to `forget_fact`. Deletes the
  `conv:{id}` point and all `moment:{id}:N` siblings for a conversation. User isolation
  enforced via `list_points` (user-scoped). Seeded into default allowlist with
  `requires_approval: true` in config.yaml — the HITL gate prevents accidental deletion.
  `recall` output was updated to include `[conversation_id]` prefix so the model has a
  handle to pass to `forget_memory`.

## Skills design decisions (agentskills.io format)

Skills are **files on disk**, never in a database. A skill is a directory containing a
`SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `allowed-tools`)
followed by Markdown instructions. The filesystem is the source of truth; `SkillStore`
only stores grant metadata (who can see which skills).

- **Progressive disclosure, three stages.**
  1. *Startup* (`service.build()`): `discover(cfg.skills.paths)` scans configured
     directories and loads `name` + `description` only — ~50 tokens/skill in the system
     message. Safe to run synchronously (filesystem I/O, no network).
  2. *Activation* (agent-driven): the agent calls `read_skill(name)` → full `SKILL.md`
     body returned as a tool observation. Body is read from disk on each call (no cache)
     so operators can update files without restarting the service.
  3. *Reference loading* (on demand): skill instructions can tell the agent to read
     `references/foo.md` using existing file tools — no special plumbing needed.

- **Context assembly.** The skills block is tier-0 (never evicted by the budgeter) and
  sits between the dynamic system prompt and the factual block:
  `base_prompt → dynamic → skills_block → factual → episodic → summary`.
  `ContextBuilder` receives `skill_manager` and `skill_store` as optional fields (default
  `None`); when both are absent the output is byte-for-byte identical to pre-skills
  context, so the golden test is unaffected.

- **`allowed-tools` is parsed, not auto-granted.** The field is stored in
  `SkillMeta.allowed_tools` for operator inspection. A skill definition never silently
  expands what a user can execute — `PermissionStore` remains the authorization boundary.
  Operators who want to grant a skill's tools can call `PermissionStore.grant(...)` explicitly.
  (V2 will add an opt-in `auto_grant_tools` policy, mirroring MCP's `auto_allow`.)

- **`SkillStore` Protocol: scaffolded for v2 per-user grants.**
  `allowed_skills(user_id) → None` means all skills are visible (v1 global default);
  `→ set[str]` means the user is restricted to exactly those names. `SkillManager` methods
  `metadata_block(allowed, header)` and `read_body(name, allowed)` both accept the allowed
  set and filter accordingly — no API change when a v2 `SqliteSkillStore` adapter is added.

- **`read_skill` permission seeding.** `read_skill` is a native tool that must be in the
  `PermissionStore` default allowlist so all users can call it. Seeding is done
  synchronously in `build_stores(cfg, extra_default_allowed={"read_skill"})` — no async
  `extend_default_allowed` call needed at startup.

- **Defense-in-depth.** `read_skill`'s handler re-checks `SkillStore.allowed_skills(user_id)`
  at execution time, mirroring `ToolRegistry.execute()`'s re-check of `PermissionStore`.

- **Script execution is deliberately deferred.** Skills can bundle `scripts/` directories per
  the agentskills.io spec, but the agent has no shell tool today. Adding one is a separate
  security decision (sandboxing, approval gates) tracked in ROADMAP.md.

## llm_kit gotchas (verified against the installed package)

- `TokenUsage` is **not** re-exported from top-level `llm_kit`; import from
  `llm_kit.llm.response`.
- `AppConfig.from_dict` / `from_yaml` **reject unknown keys** — that's why
  harness_kit's config nests the `llm_kit` block rather than appending sections.
- `LLMClient` and `OpenAICompatibleEmbedder` both accept `client=` and
  `owns_client=` — `service.py` builds one shared `httpx.AsyncClient` for both.

## MCP gotchas (verified against `mcp` 1.27.x)

- The `mcp` SDK is the **optional `mcp` extra**; `tools/mcp.py` imports it **lazily
  inside `connect()`** so the module loads without the extra (matches `stores/stubs.py`).
- Transport clients are async context managers with **different return arities**:
  `stdio_client` / `sse_client` yield `(read, write)`; `streamablehttp_client` yields
  `(read, write, get_session_id)`. `MCPServerClient` holds them open in an
  `AsyncExitStack` for the app's lifetime (they aren't one-shot calls).
- `ClientSession` requires `await session.initialize()` before `list_tools()` /
  `call_tool()`. A tool's `inputSchema` is already JSON Schema → drops straight into
  `ToolDefinition.parameters`.
- `call_tool` returns a `CallToolResult` with `content` (text blocks) and `isError`.
  harness_kit **raises** on `isError=True` so the registry yields `ToolResult(ok=False)`
  (tool errors are observations, not exceptions).
- MCP connect/discover is async, so it can't run in the **sync** `service.build()`;
  it runs in `AgentService.astart()` (called from the serving lifespan / examples).
  Native tools are wired in `build()`; MCP tools `register()` later in `astart()`.

## Per-conversation model switching

A caller can change the LLM model mid-conversation without rebuilding the service. The
override is stored in the session and takes effect on the next `run_turn` call for that
conversation; other concurrent conversations are unaffected.

**API:**
```python
await service.set_conversation_model(conversation_id, user_id, "claude-opus-4-8")
# Pass None to revert to the service default:
await service.set_conversation_model(conversation_id, user_id, None)
```

**Storage:** `SessionState.model_name: str | None` (a new field on the session record,
`None` = use the service default). The in-memory adapter stores it as a Python
attribute; `RedisSessionStore` serializes/deserializes it with `.get("model_name")` for
forward-compatibility with existing sessions that predate the field.
`ConversationMeta.model_name` is populated by `SessionStore.list()` and surfaced in
`encode_conversation` so the `/conversations` listing API exposes which model a
conversation is using.

**Resolution in `run_turn`:** After context is built, `Agent.run_turn()` does a
two-gate check before the iteration loop:
1. `self._llm_factory is not None` — can the service build per-model clients at all?
   This is `None` when an LLM was externally injected (test path with `FakeLLM`).
2. `model_override` (i.e. `SessionState.model_name`) — does *this* conversation want a
   different model? `None` for most conversations → use the service-default `self._llm`.

Both must be true to swap the LLM. `WorkingMemory.get_model_name(conversation_id,
user_id)` reads the field with a single store lookup (O(1) dict for in-memory).

**Factory:** `AgentService.build()` constructs a `_make_llm` closure when the service
builds its own `LLMClient` (not when externally injected). The closure captures the
shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, `cfg.llm_kit`, and a `_llm_cache` dict. Per-model clients
are built on first use (same connection pool, same API keys, only `model` differs) and
cached by model name so subsequent calls are free. The factory is `None` when `llm=` is
injected — `set_conversation_model` raises `ValueError` in that case.

**Serving — WebSocket:** `_receive()` handles a new message type:
```json
{"type": "set_model", "user_id": "alice", "model": "claude-opus-4-8"}
```
Pass `"model": null` to clear the override.

**Serving — REST (for SSE clients):**
```
PUT /conversations/{conversation_id}/model?user_id=alice&model=claude-opus-4-8
```
Omit `model` (or pass `null`) to clear. Returns `{"conversation_id": …, "model": …}`.

**Layering note:** `Agent` never imports `llm_kit` directly — it receives a
`Callable[[str], LLM] | None` factory from `service.py`, which is the only place
`LLMClient` is constructed. The protocol boundary is preserved.

## HITL tool approval

- **Config:** add `requires_approval: true` (and optionally `approval_timeout_s`,
  default 30 s) to a tool's `ToolPolicy` under `tools.definitions` in `config.yaml`.
- **Event flow:** the loop emits `ToolApprovalRequired(call_id, name, arguments,
  timeout_s)` *before* executing the tool (before `ToolCallStarted`). On approval it
  continues normally; on denial or timeout it emits `ToolResult(ok=False)` with a
  human-readable reason and feeds that reason back to the model as a tool-result
  observation, so the model can explain what happened to the user.
- **WebSocket:** the WS handler runs two concurrent coroutines via `asyncio.gather` —
  `_receive` (reads every incoming WS message) and `_run_turns` (drives the agent loop
  from a queue). Approval responses arrive as
  `{"type": "approval", "call_id": "…", "approved": true}` on the same connection;
  `_receive` routes them to `Agent.resolve_approval()`, which resolves the
  `asyncio.Future` the loop is awaiting.
- **SSE:** one-way transport — the loop's future is resolved to `False` immediately
  after the SSE handler yields the `ToolApprovalRequired` frame. The auto-deny appears
  as a normal `ToolResult(ok=False)` in the stream.
- **In-process caveat:** approval futures live in `Agent._pending_approvals` (in
  process memory, same as the rate-limiter). In a multi-worker deploy the approval
  response must reach the same worker as the running turn. WS connections are
  typically sticky, so this is safe in practice; a shared-store backing is a later
  scaling step if needed.

## Telemetry / tracing (Langfuse)

- **One seam, one import.** `telemetry.py` is the *only* module that imports
  `langfuse`. It's a leaf (like `tokens.py`/`retry.py`), so any layer may call it
  without breaking the bottom-up rule. Every call site uses `telemetry.span(...)` /
  `turn_span(...)` / `SpanHandle`, never a `langfuse` type — so switching to pure OTel
  (Langfuse v4 *is* OTel underneath) means reimplementing this one file, not
  re-instrumenting. Optional `telemetry` extra; lazy import inside `configure()`.
- **Off by default → no-op.** `TelemetryConfig.enabled` defaults false; every helper
  becomes a null context manager, so the default suite stays offline and the golden
  context test is untouched. `service.build()` only wraps the LLM/embedder in
  `TracingLLM`/`TracingEmbedder` when enabled, so `FakeLLM` runs bare in tests.
- **identity:** `conversation_id` → Langfuse **session**, `user_id` → Langfuse **user**
  (via `propagate_attributes` in `turn_span`), so a whole conversation groups in the UI.
- **Span tree:** `turn` (root) → `context.build` (+ the four source reads) → per-iteration
  `llm.invoke_stream` *generation* (model + token usage → Langfuse prices it, covering
  M9 cost) → `tool.execute:{name}` (outcome tag: ok/not_permitted/rate_limited/…).
  Background writes are spanned in `_guard`; they stay in the same trace because
  `asyncio.create_task` copies the OTel context live at `_enqueue` time. Conversation
  finalize is its own `conversation_end` root under the same session.
- **Streaming rule:** the `invoke_stream` wrapper must never buffer — it yields each
  `TextChunk` straight through (TTFT) and uses `start_observation`/`end()` (not a
  context manager held across `yield`s, which would shuffle the OTel current-span var).
- **Prometheus `/metrics`** — five instruments via `prometheus_client` (optional `metrics`
  extra): `harness_kit_ttft_seconds`, `harness_kit_turn_latency_seconds`,
  `harness_kit_turn_iterations`, `harness_kit_tool_calls_total` (labels `tool`+`outcome`),
  `harness_kit_retrieval_hits`. Same seam pattern as `telemetry.py`: single `metrics.py`
  leaf, no-op by default (`MetricsConfig.enabled=false`). `/metrics` returns 501 JSON
  when disabled, Prometheus text format when enabled.

## Running things

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra mcp --extra telemetry   # use --native-tls on this machine
uv run pytest                       # unit tests only, no network/Docker
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... uv run python examples/single_turn.py
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... uv run uvicorn "harness_kit.serving.app:create_app_from_yaml" --factory
```

Note: `uv` on this Windows box needs `--native-tls` or it fails with a cert error.

## Live integration tests

`tests/integration/` is an opt-in suite that exercises real LLM calls.
Skipped by default; enabled by setting `LIVE_TESTS_ENABLED=1`.

**Setup:**
1. Edit `config_live.yaml` (project root) to set your provider, model, and
   `api_key_env` (the name of the env var holding your API key).
2. Export your API key under that name (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...`).
3. Run: `LIVE_TESTS_ENABLED=1 uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v`

The embedder is always `FakeEmbedder` — no embed endpoint is needed.
All stores are in-memory; no external infra required beyond the LLM key.

**Coverage areas:**
- `test_streaming.py` — event sequence and token usage invariants
- `test_tool_roundtrip.py` — real LLM calls `remember_fact`, ≥2 iterations
- `test_native_memory_tools.py` — `list_facts`, `forget_fact`, `recall` invoked by real LLM
- `test_working_memory.py` — rollover fires when `buffer_token_budget` is exceeded
- `test_episodic_memory.py` — `end_conversation` writes one vector point per conversation
- `test_factual_extraction.py` — durable facts extracted; ephemeral context omitted
- `test_skills.py` — skill discovered at startup; `read_skill` called; instructions followed

## Testing posture

`FakeLLM` (in `tests/conftest.py`) replays scripted streamed turns (text chunks +
`StreamEnd` with tool calls); `make_service(cfg, turns=...)` wires it into the real
stores. Mirrors `llm_kit`'s own fake-driven posture. **No live-key tests in-repo
today** — but that will change (see ROADMAP: live integration testing is a planned,
opt-in, key-gated suite). Keep new unit tests network-free.

## Project wiki (docs/wiki/)

This project maintains a self-referential wiki — a persistent, cross-linked knowledge
base about harness_kit itself: design decisions, architectural concepts, module
responsibilities, and design rationale. It's built using Claude Code skills that read
the codebase and existing docs, synthesize them into wiki pages, and keep the wiki
current as the project evolves.

**Architecture: three layers.**

1. **Sources** — the codebase and existing project docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
   `docs/config.md`, `docs/conversation_flow.md`, `src/harness_kit/**`) are the
   primary, authoritative source of truth. Additionally, `docs/raw/` holds external
   reference material (meeting notes, articles, design documents) — immutable once
   filed.
2. **Wiki** — `docs/wiki/` is LLM-owned, generated markdown. Pages are organized by
   category: `entities/` (modules, subsystems, tools), `concepts/` (recurring ideas
   and patterns), `decisions/` (design rationale and tradeoffs), `sources/` (summaries
   of external documents), `synthesis/` (high-level analysis tying multiple topics).
   `index.md` is a content-oriented catalog; `log.md` is an append-only operation
   log.
3. **Schema** — this section of CLAUDE.md documents conventions (frontmatter, naming,
   workflows) so the skills know how to build and maintain the wiki consistently.

**Page frontmatter** (every page under `docs/wiki/pages/`):

```yaml
---
title: <Page Title>
category: concept|entity|decision|source|synthesis
tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sources: [src/harness_kit/agent/loop.py, CLAUDE.md#Skills design decisions, docs/raw/design-notes.md, ...]
status: draft|current|superseded
---
```

`sources:` records provenance — code/doc paths for code-derived pages, `docs/raw/<file>`
for external documents. Cross-references use `[[pages/<category>/<slug>]]` (Obsidian
style, matching the spec's graph-view workflow).

**Index and log.**

- `index.md` — catalog organized by category (`## Sources`, `## Concepts`, etc.),
  each entry a one-line link + one-line summary + date. Updated on every ingest or
  query-file.
- `log.md` — append-only chronological record: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <Title>`,
  where `op ∈ {ingest, query, lint}`. Parseable: `grep "^## \[" docs/wiki/log.md |
  tail -5` shows recent activity.

**Skills** (three Claude Code slash commands, in `.claude/skills/`):

- **`/wiki-ingest <path-or-topic>`** — read a code path, project doc, or external
  document; synthesize wiki pages and integrate them into the existing structure.
  Supports two modes: code ingest (read the codebase in place) and document ingest
  (save external material to `docs/raw/` first). Stays involved — discusses takeaways
  with the user and confirms before broad edits. Flags contradictions if new material
  conflicts with existing pages.
- **`/wiki-query <question>`** — search the compiled wiki (starting from `index.md`)
  and synthesize an answer with citations. Optionally files nontrivial synthesis
  back into the wiki as a new `synthesis/` or updated `concepts/` page (asks first).
- **`/wiki-lint`** — audit the wiki for broken links, orphan pages, missing index
  entries, contradictions, stale claims, and missing cross-references. Reports
  findings grouped by severity; asks the user before structural changes.

## When you change something

- Re-run `uv run pytest`. The golden context test (`tests/test_context.py`) asserts
  the *exact* assembled message list — if you change assembly order or block
  formatting, update it deliberately.
- Keep the layering. Keep it async. Keep it user-scoped.
- **If you change the config structure** (add/remove/rename fields in `src/harness_kit/config/schema.py`),
  update [docs/config.md](docs/config.md) with the new field(s), including type, default, and purpose.
  This keeps the operator-facing documentation in sync with the code.
- Update [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) when you complete or start a milestone.
